# Wikipedia Matrix

Wikipedia Matrix is a table extractor by two means : HTML and WIKITEXT.
The aim of this project is to take up the first two versions of the project that have been made
in the last two years by the students of Master degree in order to make a global review. 

The aim of the project was to extract as many relevant tables as possible from wikipedia links, the output format being csv.
We must now analyse the quality of the two data extractors HTML and WIKITEXT in order to
draw conclusions and propose areas for improvement while correcting any problems that arise. 

Like any project, we have several different versions and the aim is to improve it,
from version to version over time to make it more powerful and better than the other versions. 
The current objective is to have a better extractor than the other versions.
The previous versions were in Java and now we have to make it in Python.
